              Hi! I'm <b>Ashish Tripathi</b>, a passionate <b>Software Engineer</b> with 
              <b> 2.5+ years of hands-on experience</b> in building scalable and

              designing <b>REST APIs</b>, building <b>microservices</b>, integrating   
              <b> MongoDB & Redis</b>, and leading efforts in <b>web/app scraping </b> 
              using <b>Puppeteer, Electron, and Frida</b>. I also guided new team members 
              by assigning tasks and reviewing their work, strengthening my leadership 
              and collaboration skills.

              Beyond technical expertise, I enjoy solving challenging <b>DSA problems</b>, 
              working in <b>Agile teams</b>, and contributing to impactful projects.

              <b> E-Commerce Platform</b>, <b>URL Shortener</b>, 
              <b> Book Management System</b>, and a <b>Chat Application</b>.
